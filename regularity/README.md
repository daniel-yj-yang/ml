# Regularity of the world

Humans have the natural tendency to organize the world in terms of its pattern or regularity (e.g., structure or dynamics). 

It is seen in the human language and thought process. Categorization happens within few seconds when we see other objects. Also humans want to use limited cognitive capacity to grasp the full complexity of the world.

But categorization or language abstraction require energy.

Can we use the computer to do these kinds of works? Even has performance better than humans?

This is why ML is important.
